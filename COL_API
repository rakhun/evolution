unsigned char command, unsigned char arg
Written form:
F0:0D
2:7f

Specifics: in functions using x-128, the value will be increased by one if the result is 0 or more, this is to make the maximum and minimum values more even, and an argument of zero would give no result either way

0 Walk		Length (x-128)	Walk, longer distance gives higher health
				  penalty

				  angle
2 Jump		Length (x-128)	Jump $Length steps with the pointer
3 Look		Datasize	Write visual information to memory, scaling
				  resolution to fit the datasize.
4 Mempointer	Length (x-128)	Move the memory pointer $Length steps
5 If		Value		Execute the following command if
				  mem[$memP]=$Value
6 IfNot		Value		Execute the following command if
				  mem[$memP]!=$Value
7 IfMore	Value		Execute the following command if
